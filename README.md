fun project i'm using to learn coding  
if you want to use this as a template you're free to do so just put me in the description or readme or whatever you wanna do to credit me

## todo:  
-a lot more passive buyables  
-add upgrades  
-add a neat little fading popup on your cursor with the amount of money you got from clicking the find money button (i might have oversimplified this explanation)  
-something fun like city building maybe as like a gimmick  
-probably other stuff
